  <div class="role">
    <div class="role-header">
      <h3>Technical Lead, Square Websites + AI Website Editor</h3>
      <span class="dates">2023 - 2026</span>
    </div>
    <div class="company">Square (Block, Inc.)</div>
    <div class="context">Recruited to lead AI website editing. Built the prototypes, led the team, and saw the project through to becoming the designated replacement for Square Online's website building capabilities and a code-red company priority.</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Started the AI website editor initiative in 2023 with UXR and early prototypes proving that GPT-3 and 3.5 could generate working UI components and perform edits through tool routing. Delivered iterative demos across multiple quarters to prove feasibility to leadership unfamiliar with AI capabilities.</li>
      <li>In early 2025, built a full working prototype of the website editor using AI-assisted development (Cursor, Claude 3.5), structured with design docs, milestones, and defined acceptance criteria. Presented it to senior leadership, which secured resourcing to form a dedicated team.</li>
      <li>Technical lead on a team of six (PM, designer, 2 ML engineers, infrastructure engineer). Owned engineering roadmap planning and served as primary planning partner for our PM. The architecture uses an LLM-safe JSON data model with static validation, so the LLM edits structured data instead of code and errors are caught before save. Contributed over 60% of the codebase.</li>
      <li>Coordinated formal feedback with an ML engineer's manager to resolve a recurring interpersonal conflict on the team. Escalated roadmap concerns to keep the project on track.</li>
      <li>Named AI Champion for Square's web organization. Talked to engineers across the org about how they were using AI, found the common gaps, and built shared infrastructure to fill them.</li>
      <li>Created Square's shared TypeScript MCP service for deploying and testing Model Context Protocol servers. Built the Mosaic MCP for website editing tools and a TypeDoc MCP that surfaced component type information. The shared service was adopted by Square AI for their Cube MCP (data warehouse access) and a Google Maps integration.</li>
      <li>Started the Generative UI Working Group at Block, connecting teams from Goose, Square Web, and internal AI tooling. The group's work led to Mosaic being adopted as a shared rendering engine by multiple teams building LLM-driven interfaces.</li>
      <li>The project was elevated to a code-red priority in early 2026 and is the basis for Square's upcoming website editing product.</li>
    </ul>

      <h3>Technical Lead, Checkout</h3>
      <span class="dates">2022 - 2023</span>
    </div>
    <div class="company">Square (Block, Inc.)</div>
    <div class="context">Tech lead on the checkout team, focused on conversion, reliability, and buyer authenticated payments.</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Defined workstreams for frontend and backend instrumentation to find where checkout was failing.</li>
      <li>Ran a bug-fixing effort where we quantified the GPV impact of each issue to prioritize fixes. Checkout conversion improved from the low 90s to the high 90s (percentage points).</li>
      <li>Mentored a mid-level engineer through the reliability work and wrote their promotion packet based on the impact they delivered. They were promoted.</li>
      <li>Led three engineers as DRI on a Square Pay redesign (later deprioritized).</li>

    </div>
    <div class="company">Square (Block, Inc.)</div>
    <div class="context">Virtual Terminal, then the public-facing Square Web Payments SDK.</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Responsible for the public API design of the new Web Payments SDK (the replacement for SqPaymentForm). Worked with internal teams and developers already using the old SDK to get the interface right.</li>
      <li>Implemented ACH bank payments through a Plaid integration and migrated Google Pay to the new SDK.</li>
      <li>Led Payments UI, a project I proposed: a pre-built micro-checkout that wrapped the SDK so developers could support every payment method from a single init call and get new methods automatically.</li>
      <li>On Virtual Terminal, recruited by a skip-level leader to join the team during a transition and provide candid feedback on team health and process. Worked on the order editor for itemized transactions, added customer support, and ran A/B tests on entry points to improve product usage.</li>
      <li>Conducted over 100 engineering interviews a year during Square's peak hiring. Authored a frontend screening question that became a standard part of the loop.</li>
